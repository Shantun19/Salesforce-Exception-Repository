❌ Error Message Summary:
System.EmailException: SendEmail failed.
NO_MASS_MAIL_PERMISSION, Single email is not enabled for your organization or profile.

🧠 What it Means
Salesforce is trying to send an email from a Flow or Process Builder (Business Registration Email Sent on Business Filing Status), but it's not allowed because:
  1.Your Profile or Org Settings don’t have permission to send emails.
  2.Salesforce has a setting called "Single email" which is disabled for your profile or org.
  3.This restriction prevents both manual and automated emails.

🛠️ How to Fix It:
Ask your Salesforce Admin to do the following:

✅ Step 1: Enable Email Deliverability
  Go to Setup → Email → Deliverability
  Set Access Level to: All email
✅ Step 2: Check Profile Email Permissions
  Go to your User's Profile
  Under Administrative Permissions, make sure:
    ✅ Send Email is checked
    ✅ Mass Email (optional but useful) is enabled
✅ Step 3: Confirm Email is Enabled in Org
  Ensure that Email Sending is not disabled in any org-wide settings or sandboxes.
