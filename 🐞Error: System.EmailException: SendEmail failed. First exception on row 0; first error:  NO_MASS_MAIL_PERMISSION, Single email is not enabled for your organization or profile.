❌ Error:
System.EmailException: SendEmail failed.
First exception on row 0; first error: 
NO_MASS_MAIL_PERMISSION, Single email is not enabled for your organization or profile.

🧠 What This Means:
You're trying to send an email using Apex (or via a Flow that uses Apex/email alert behind the scenes), but Salesforce blocked it because:
1.Single email sending is disabled either:
  For your Salesforce org (globally), or
  For your User Profile (individually)
2.The error code NO_MASS_MAIL_PERMISSION is a bit misleading — even though it says "mass mail", it actually means:
  Your org/profile doesn't have permission to send even individual emails via code or automation.

🛠️ How to Fix It:
Your Salesforce Admin needs to do one or more of the following:

✅ Step 1: Enable Email Deliverability
Go to: Setup → Email → Deliverability
  Set Access Level to: All email

---------------------------------

✅ Step 2: Check Profile Permissions
Go to: Setup → Profiles → [Your Profile]
  Ensure these are checked under Administrative Permissions:
  ✅ Send Email
  ✅ Mass Email (optional but useful)

---------------------------------

✅ Step 3: Sandbox-Specific Issue?
If you're in a sandbox, Salesforce may block outbound emails by default:
  Still go to: Setup → Email → Deliverability
  Make sure Access Level is set to All email, not System email only
