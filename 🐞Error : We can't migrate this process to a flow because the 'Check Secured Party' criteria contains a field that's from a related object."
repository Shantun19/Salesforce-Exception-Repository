‚ùå Error During Migration
"We can't migrate this process to a flow because the 'Check Secured Party' criteria contains a field that's from a related object."

üß† Why This Happens
Salesforce‚Äôs ‚ÄúMigrate to Flow‚Äù tool has a limitation:
  It cannot migrate Process Builder criteria that reference fields from related objects (like Assignor_ID__r.Name).
  In your Process Builder:
    Your Check Secured Party criteria uses something like:
      Assignor_ID__r.Name (i.e., a cross-object reference)
This kind of reference works fine in Process Builder, but the migration tool doesn‚Äôt support it.
üîç Example of Unsupported Field
If you have a field update or condition like this:
  [UCC_Entity_Info__c ].Assignor_ID__r.Name
  ‚úÖ Allowed in PB
  ‚ùå Not allowed in Flow migration tool

----------------------------------------------------
‚úÖ What You Can Do
‚úî Option 1: Manually Rebuild the Flow
Since the migration tool won‚Äôt handle it, you‚Äôll need to rebuild this Process manually in Flow:
1.Go to Setup ‚Üí Flows ‚Üí New Flow
2.Create a Record-Triggered Flow on UCC_Entity_Info__c (or your object)
3.Recreate the Check Secured Party logic using:
4.Then add Assignment elements to update:
  Secured_Party_ID__c
  Assignor_ID__c
  Filing_ID__c
  Assignor_ID__r.Name (indirectly via a Get + assignment)

 ‚úî Option 2: Remove Related Field & Migrate, Then Add It Back
If you want to use the migration tool partially:
  1.Temporarily remove the related-object reference (e.g., Assignor_ID__r.Name) from the PB.
  2.Migrate the Process using the tool.
  3.Then go to the new Flow and manually add that field reference using:
    A Get Records step to fetch Assignor_ID__r
    And then assign Name to the needed variable or field.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You‚Äôre using a related-object field like `Assignor_ID__r.Name` in the PB criteria | Migrate manually, or remove that field temporarily and re-add it in Flow after migration |
