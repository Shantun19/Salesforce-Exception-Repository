üìå Description
===============
When attempting to convert a Lead in Salesforce, the following error is thrown:


Error: ConvertLead failed. First exception on row 0; first error: UNAVAILABLE_RECORDTYPE_EXCEPTION, Unable to find default record type: []

‚ùì Why This Error Occurred
==========================
This error indicates that Salesforce couldn't find a default Record Type for the object being created during Lead conversion ‚Äî typically the Account, Contact, or Opportunity.

The cause is usually one of the following:

The user performing the conversion does not have access to any Record Types for one or more of the objects.
A default Record Type is not set for the user‚Äôs profile for that object.
Record Types were deleted or changed, and default associations were broken.
The Lead conversion is being done via code or automation (like Apex) without explicitly specifying a Record Type.

‚úÖ Solution
============
Go to Setup ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí [User‚Äôs Profile] ‚Üí Object Settings ‚Üí [Object like Account, Contact, Opportunity] ‚Üí Record Types.
Ensure at least one Record Type is assigned and marked as default.
